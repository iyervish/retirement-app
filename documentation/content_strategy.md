# Content Strategy & Messaging Framework

## Core Messaging Architecture

### The Retirement Planning Problem
**What people actually think**: "I have no idea if I'm saving enough, and I'm too scared to find out"
**What they really want**: "Tell me I'll be okay, and show me exactly what to do"
**Your solution**: "Work with certified financial planners who will create a personalized retirement strategy just for you"

### Value Proposition Hierarchy

**Primary Promise** (Hero Section):
"Work with certified financial planners to plan your retirement"

## Message Testing Framework

**Their Internal Dialogue**: "I'm behind on savings, have no clue when I can stop working"
**Your Message Must Address**: 
- Professional guidance (not DIY planning)

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Writing Principles

**Conversational, Not Corporate**:
- ❌ "Our comprehensive retirement optimization platform"
- ✅ "We'll work with you to create your retirement plan"

**Specific, Not Generic**:
- ❌ "Achieve your retirement goals"
- ✅ "Work with certified financial planners to optimize your retirement strategy"

**Confident, Not Cocky**:
- ❌ "We guarantee you'll retire comfortably"
- ✅ "Our certified planners will help you understand where you stand and create a plan"

**Empathetic, Not Dismissive**:
- ❌ "Retirement planning is simple"
- ✅ "Retirement planning feels overwhelming - that's why we're here to help"

### Emotional Messaging Strategy

**Address the Fear**: Acknowledge that retirement anxiety is real and valid
**Provide Professional Support**: Connect them with certified financial planners
**Build Confidence**: Show the value of working with experts
**Maintain Hope**: Focus on personalized guidance, not limitations

## Content Templates

### Problem/Solution Format
```
[Specific problem they face]
[Why current solutions don't work]
[How your approach is different]
[Specific benefit they get]
```

**Example**:
"Most retirement calculators tell you to save '$1.2 million' - but what does that actually mean for your life? Generic advice doesn't account for your real situation. Our certified financial planners analyze your complete financial picture and create a personalized retirement strategy. Instead of scary numbers, you get expert guidance and a clear plan."

### Feature Description Template
```
[Clear capability statement]
[Why this matters to them]
[Specific example or outcome]
```

**Example**:
"Maintain an ongoing relationship with your certified financial planner as your salary grows and savings increase. Life changes, and your retirement plan should too. Your planner will help you see how that promotion or side hustle impacts your retirement strategy."

## Social Proof Strategy

### Testimonial Framework
**Focus on outcomes, not features**:
- ❌ "The consultation was easy to schedule"
- ✅ "Working with my financial planner helped me retire 2 years earlier than I thought"

**Include specific details**:
- ❌ "This really helped me plan"
- ✅ "My planner showed me that maxing my HSA would let me retire at 62 instead of 65"

**Address common concerns**:
- Fear: "I was terrified I'd never be able to retire"
- Confusion: "My planner helped me finally understand where I actually stand"
- Action: "My planner recommended three changes that saved me 4 years"

### Authority Building (Without Being Pompous)
- **Instead of credentials**: Focus on CFP® certification and track record
- **Instead of awards**: Use specific client outcomes  
- **Instead of partnerships**: Mention professional standards and ongoing education

## FAQ Content Strategy

### Address Real Objections
**Not marketing FAQ - actual user concerns**:

1. **"How is this different from online calculators?"**
   - Answer: Explain how certified financial planners provide personalized guidance vs. generic tools

2. **"What if my situation is complicated?"**
   - Answer: Address how certified planners handle complex situations

3. **"Do I need to be wealthy to work with a planner?"**
   - Answer: Explain that planners work with clients at all income levels

4. **"What if I'm way behind on savings?"**
   - Answer: Focus on how planners help create realistic recovery plans

5. **"How much does working with a planner cost?"**
   - Answer: Explain the value of professional guidance and ongoing support

## Call-to-Action Strategy

### Primary CTA Psychology
**"Get My Free Consultation"** works because:
- Personal ("My" not "Your")
- Specific outcome (consultation, not vague "plan")
- Low commitment (free, no obligation)
- Professional guidance implied

### Secondary CTA Options
- **"Schedule Consultation"** (process-focused)
- **"Meet My Planner"** (relationship-focused)
- **"Learn About Our Process"** (education-focused)

### CTA Placement Strategy
- **Hero**: Primary CTA only, make it obvious
- **Mid-page**: After explaining value, repeat primary CTA
- **End of features**: Secondary CTA with different messaging
- **Footer**: Soft CTA, lower pressure

## Content Optimization Guidelines

### Readability Requirements
- **Flesch Reading Score**: 60+ (8th grade level)
- **Sentence length**: 20 words maximum average
- **Paragraph length**: 3 sentences maximum
- **Subheadings**: Every 150-200 words

### Emotional Pacing
1. **Hook with problem** (anxiety/uncertainty)
2. **Promise solution** (specific outcome)
3. **Explain approach** (how it works)
4. **Show benefits** (what changes for them)
5. **Remove barriers** (address objections)
6. **Request action** (clear next step)

### Mobile Content Considerations
- **Headlines**: 40 characters max for mobile display
- **Subheadings**: 60 characters max
- **Button text**: 20 characters max
- **Paragraphs**: 2-3 lines max on mobile screen

This messaging framework ensures every word serves the goal of moving anxious, confused prospects toward taking action. The key is addressing their real emotional state, not just rational needs.
